Visualize total sales, sales by region, and sales trends over time.
Use line charts, bar charts, or cards to display key sales figures.

Display inventory levels, low-stock alerts, and product categories.
Consider using visuals like stacked bar charts or cards for inventory metrics.
Customer Demographics:

Use pie charts or bar charts to show customer demographics like age groups, gender, and location.

Compare the performance of different stores or regions.
Utilize maps, tables, or charts for a quick overview.
5. Geospatial Visualization:
Use maps to show the geographical distribution of stores and their performance.

Allow users to select specific regions, time periods, or other dimensions.
10. Alerts and KPIs:
Set up conditional formatting or indicators to highlight KPIs and performance against targets.
Include alerts for critical metrics like low inventory or a significant drop in sales.
